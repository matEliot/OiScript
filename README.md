A silly "coding language" that I made for my YouTube chanel that just hinges on Python.
The zip file includes a manual as well as a Connect 4 bot written in OiScript (not very strong and a bit slow).
The .py file has all the code that went into the making of the executable in the zip file and is not necessary to download.
